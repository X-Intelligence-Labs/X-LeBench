# Ignore previous conversations and focus solely on the below task.

**Instruction:**
Your job is to organize and integrate a personâ€™s daily plan by dividing their activities into multiple "plan chunks," each with an appropriate time period.
 Ensure each chunk has a *start and end time*, that activities within each chunk are reasonably grouped, and that the timeline aligns with practical, real-life schedules. 
 All information should match the input plan details and respect natural activity pacing.

**Task Description:**
1. Divide the daily plan: Segment the daily activities into at least **<chunk_num>** chunks, assigning a realistic and coherent time period for each chunk, with a 5-20 minute interval between chunks to ensure realistical and logical continuity.
2. Time Allocation: Allocate a start and end time for each chunk that reflects a logical flow for the day.
3. Activity Integration: For each time period, group and summarize main activities in a way that accurately and concisely reflects the daily plan.
4. Maintain Real-Life Consistency: Ensure each plan chunk aligns with realistic timing, without introducing activities or altering the sequence provided.


**Example:**
*Input:*
"daily_plan": [
        "Wake up at 06:30",
        "Prepare a healthy breakfast at 06:30 - 07:00",
        "Read the news and check emails at 07:00 - 07:30",
        "Commute to work by 08:00",
        "Review and finalize reports at 09:00 - 11:30",
        "Lunch break at 12:00 - 13:00",
        "Respond to emails and manage client inquiries at 13:00 - 15:00",
        ...,
        ...
    ]

*Output:*
```json
{
  "daily_plan_chunk": [
    {
      "start_time": "06:30",
      "plan_chunk": "Wake up, prepare a healthy breakfast, eat while catching up on the news headlines, check emails",
      "end_time": "07:45"
    },
    {
      "start_time": "07:55",
      "plan_chunk": "Commute to work, listening to a podcast or audiobook during the journey",
      "end_time": "08:25"
    },
    {
      "start_time": "08:30",
      "plan_chunk": "Arrive at work, settle in and prepare for the day's tasks.",
      "end_time": "08:55"
    },
    ...,
    ...
  ]
}
```

Please provide the daily_plan_chunk in the above JSON format and NOT include other outputs.
 Ensure all time references are in 24-hour format (HH:MM), for example, 15:30.
 Ensure each activity chunk is complete, accurate, and aligns with the logical flow of realistic day, including brief intervals between chunks.
 Ensure output daily_plan_chunk has at least **<chunk_num>** chunks.

**Execute:**
Now, given below daily plan, you need to perform the tasks described above.
daily_plan: <daily_plan>
