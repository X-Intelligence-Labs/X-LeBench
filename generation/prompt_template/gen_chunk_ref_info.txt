# Ignore previous conversations and focus solely on the below task.

### Instructions: 
You will receive a time-based *activity plan* that includes a start time, activity description, and end time, along with a *reference list of scenarios*. Your goal is to analyze the activity plan and select the most appropriate scenario(s) from the reference list based on the described activities. Additionally, infer whether the activities are likely to take place in an *indoor, outdoor, or mixed* location based on the nature of the activity.

### Task Description:
1. Provide an analysis for why each scenario was chosen from the reference list, explaining how it matches the activity description, and explain why a particular location (indoor, outdoor, or mixed) was inferred for this activity plan.
2. Activity Matching: For the given activity plan, review the activity description and select the most suitable scenario(s) from the provided reference list. The selected scenario(s) must match the reference list exactly; do not modify the wording.
3. Location Inference: Based on the activities described, infer the most likely location category:
 - "indoor": Activities likely confined to indoor spaces.
 - "outdoor": Activities likely in outdoor environments.
 - "mixed": Activities that transition or involve both indoor and outdoor settings.
4. Format the results in JSON as outlined below.

### Reference List
Scenarios: <scenarios>

### Example: 
*Input activity plan*:
start_time: 09:00 
activity_plan: "Prepare breakfast and eat with family." 
end_time: 10:00

*Output*

```json
{
    "analysis": "1. The activity describes preparing food and eating with family. The 'Cooking' senario align with the preparing food activity, the 'Eating' and 'Talking with family members' scenarios align perfectly with the eat with family activity. 2. Since the activity involves cooking and eating at home, it is reasonable to infer that the environment is indoor.",
    "matched_scenarios": ["Cooking", "Eating", "Talking with family members"],
    "location": "indoor"
}
```

### Execute:
 Now given the below activity plan, perform tasks above.
 Notes: Ensure scenario selections *match the reference list exactly* and location match one of the given categories ("indoor", "outdoor", "mixed").

 Activity plan: 
 start_time: <start_time> 
 activity_plan: <plan_chunk> 
 end_time: <end_time>
