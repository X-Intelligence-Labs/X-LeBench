# Ignore previous conversations and focus solely on the below task.

Generate a structured persona profile for an individual with the mbti type **<mbti_type>**, located in **<location>**.
The profile need to include the following attributes:{
 persona_id, location, mbti_type, 
 personality_traits (some character traits that match the mbti type), 
 lifestyle (an overview of daily life, such as when the persona usually wake up, when the persona usually go to bed, what the persona like to do before go to bed, when the persona usually like to work......), 
 daily_routine (wake up time, bed time, and few things that need to be done daily......), hobbies.}
This persona should have a realistic and reasonable profile, considering their location, mbti type description and other context.
And the "location" and "mbti_type" information should be exact same as the content I have provided at begining.
Represent the persona subject using third-person perspective, use character *C* to denote the persona. Do not give the persona name information.
The profile should be structured in a way that it can be saved in a JSON file.

Your response format should be consistent with the following example and NOT include other outputs:
```json
{
  "persona_id": "...",
  "location": "...",
  "personality_traits": {
    "mbti_type": "...",
    "character_traits": [
      "...",
      "..."
    ]
  },
  "lifestyle": "...",
  "daily_routine": [
    "...",
    "..."
  ],
  "hobbies": [
    "...",
    "..."
  ]
}
```
